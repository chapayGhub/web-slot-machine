This is a technical exercise.

The framework used is WEB2PY, which is a python based MVC framework for rapid web development.
It was selected because of previous experience working with it.

This repository only contains the files that need to be deployed in a WEB2PY installation.


The main components are listed below.  If you would like to browser the source code this is what you will want to view.

models/db.py contains the very simple model.

controllers/default.py  is the controller which holds the application's business logic.

views/layout.html is a template included by other views which describes the layout.

views/default/login.html take care of user login

views/default/evict_user.html explains to the user that they've run out of credit

views/default/play.html holds the most important view, the game itself.



bootstrap.css is a css framework selected because it is great for "bootstrapping" an application.
Although the fanciest transitions are only supported by webkit based browsers (Chrome, Safari, iOS browser...) the presentation degrades gracefully for other browsers.

Once the user is logged into the game, jQuery is used to update the page to reflect updates in game state asynchronously.
Further, a polling function is included so that if a user is logged in in multiple browser windows, the number of credits displayed with continuously be updated.

Improvements that would be implemented given more time have been recorded as issues.
